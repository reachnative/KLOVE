### More Details
Currently, I have used C# primarily in Sitecore and familiar with the Helix Principles, but haven't used much of API or Entity Framework to create a database. However, I'm very eager to learn more about .NET Core as being a Software Developer has been a huge passion of mine. I began my C# journey by taking a class online at Southern New Hampshire University in May 2019 and have utilize in at my current role ever since, but primarily have setup Google Scripts and connect code to fields for Renderings, Templates, Standard Values in those templates, and assist in creating beautiful UI's. If there is a better position for me to be in while I learn more about utilizing Entity Framework and connecting to an API using C# that would be great. If not, I totally understand the business need for a developer with the needed experience; but I am passionate in learning daily in this language.
